    "> To the pioneers such as Bernoulli, Bayes and Laplace, a probability represented a _degree-of-belief_ or plausibility; how much they thought that something was true, based on the evidence at hand. To the 19th century scholars, however, this seemed too vague and subjective an idea to be the basis of a rigorous mathematical theory. So they redefined probability as the _long-run relative frequency_ with which an event occurred, given (infinitely) many repeated (experimental) trials. Since frequencies can be measured, probability was now seen as an objective tool for dealing with _random_ phenomena.\n",

These are different enough cases to warrant special mention of this & two different names: the former is called a _probability mass function_ (PMF) and the latter a _probability distribution function_ (PDF). Time permitting, we may discuss some of the subtleties here. If not, all good texts will cover this. I like (Sivia & Skilling, 2006), among many others.\n"

    "In the book [Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Information-Theory-Inference-Learning-Algorithms/dp/0521642981) David MacKay tells the tale of a town called Poissonville, in which the buses have an odd schedule. Standing at a bus stop in Poissonville, the amount of time you have to wait for a bus is totally independent of when the previous bus arrived. This means you could watch a bus drive off and another arrive almost instantaneously, or you could be waiting for hours.\n",

    "Arrival of buses in Poissonville is what we call a Poisson process. The timing of the next event is completely independent of when the previous event happened. Many real-life processes behave in this way. \n",

    "* Landings on a website;\n",
    "* Meteor strikes;\n",
    "* Molecular collisions in a gas;\n",
    "* Aviation incidents.\n",

The Poisson distribution has one parameter, the average number of arrivals in a given length of time. So, to match the story, we could consider the number of hits on a website in an hour with an average of six hits per hour. This is Poisson distributed."

    "To see this, think about the stories. Picture this: you're doing a Bernoulli trial once a  minute for an hour, each with a success probability of 0.05. We would do 60 trials, and the number of successes is Binomially distributed, and we would expect to get about 3 successes. This is just like the Poisson story of seeing 3 buses on average arrive in a given interval of time. Thus the Poisson distribution with arrival rate equal to np approximates a Binomial distribution for n Bernoulli trials with probability p of success (with n large and p small). This is useful because the Poisson distribution can be simpler to work with as it has only one parameter instead of two for the Binomial distribution."

    "> We could model field goal attempts in a basketball game using a Poisson distribution. When a player takes a shot is a largely stochastic process, being influenced by the myriad ebbs and flows of a basketball game. Some players shoot more than others, though, so there is a well-defined rate of shooting. Let's consider LeBron James's field goal attempts for the 2017-2018 NBA season."

    "We've encountered a variety of named _discrete distributions_. There are also named _continuous distributions_, such as the Exponential distribution and the Normal (or Gaussian) distribution. To see what the story of the Exponential distribution is, let's return to Poissonville, in which the number of buses that will arrive per hour are Poisson distributed.\n",
    "However, the waiting time between arrivals of a Poisson process are exponentially distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So: the exponential distribution has the following story: the waiting time between arrivals of a Poisson process are exponentially distributed. It has a single parameter, the mean waiting time. This distribution is not peaked, as we can see from its PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an illustrative example, lets check out the time between all incidents involving nuclear power since 1974. It's a reasonable first approximation to expect incidents to be well-modeled by a Poisson process, which means the timing of one incident is independent of all others. If this is the case, the time between incidents should be Exponentially distributed.\n",
